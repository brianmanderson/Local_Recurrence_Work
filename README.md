"# Local_Recurrence_Work" 

This is work done to create a pseudo-raytrace to identify if the 5mm minimum ablation margin is occuring in the same region as the local recurrence.

The 'Proof_Of_Concept_Cross' takes two rois, defined as 'Test_Ablation' and 'Test_Cross', shown in the 'Picture_With_Cross_Explanation' as the yellow cylinder and blue cross.
The min_max picture shows a very fast approach that only looks at the minimum/maximum phi/theta in spherical coorindates to draw a cone of influence.
The not min_max picture show a slightly slower approach to identify fine edges.

It is recommended not to use a margin greater than 100, as the process becomes increasingly slow with more points.
It is recommended to use a margin_rad of at least 5 degrees.
