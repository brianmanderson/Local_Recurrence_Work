The goal is to find if a relationship exists between the recurrence on follow-up imaging and the minimum ablation margin

Problems: Large time changes exist between post-treatment and recurrence imaging, ablation shrinkage makes
biomechanical modeling and mapping highly biased

Potential solution: perfrom a rigid registration between the post-treatment liver and recurrence liver, focused on liver roi
Identify spherical coordinates between centroid of ablation and recurrence on recurrence imaging
Identify if minimum ablation 5mm outside of ablation zone is within spherical coorindates located above

Recurrence image should have four ROIs of interest:
Ablation, GTV_Exp_5mm_outside_Ablation, Ablation_Recurrence, recurrence

Use Ablation_Recurrence and recurrence to find angles of interest

see if GTV_Exp_5mm_outside_Ablation to Ablation is within these coordinates


For registration, to be most consistent, we will register the vasculature within a 5 cm expansion about the center of
the ablation region on the post-treatment and recurrence image
